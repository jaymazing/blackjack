# Game Rules  

For my project I will simulate the card game black jack. The game consists of 4
players and a dealer.

## Equipment:
The game requires a deck of 52 cards. It will be played on a 20x5 grid board.
The grid squares will be where the players and dealers cards are shown. Cards
will be represented with letters and numbers. For example a four of spades will
be represented by a "S4"

Suggested changes:

Rather than use letters and numbers I personally recommend using the numbers from 1-52 to represent
every card within the deck. For instance card numbers 1, 14, 27, 40 are all Aces. Therefore from
1-13 shall be every Spade card and from 14-26 shall be every Hearts card. It's ordered like this
since the rank of the suits is spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds.

## Game Play:    
Each player is dealt two cards which will be from a stack with the 52 deck of cards
in order by first number then suit and the dealer
will also have two cards. One of the dealers cards will be showing and the other
hidden. Both of the players cards will be showing. Numbered cards are worth their
face value and Jack, Queen, and Kings are worth 10. An Ace can be worth one or
eleven. If a players first two cards are a face card and an ace they automatically
win. Players to not play against each other though, rather against the house.
Once cards are dealt each player will take their turn. Players will have the
option to hit or stand. If they stand their turn is over but if they hit they
will be given another card. Players can hit as long as they are below 22.
Once all the players are done the dealer will go. The dealer will always hit
if they are below 17. If anyone cards total to over 21 they bust and lose.The 
Players will play for 10 rounds and how many games they have won will be counted
and displayed.

## Objective:  
Players either want blackjack, the dealer to bust, or end up with a higher card
total than the dealer. If the dealer has a higher card total or they bust they
lose. If they match the dealers card total they neither win nor lose.
